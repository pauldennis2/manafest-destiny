# Mana-fest Destiny

## Project Overview
Mana-fest Destiny is a data science project focused on **predicting deck performance in Magic: The Gathering (MTG) draft formats**. Using regression modeling and advanced statistical analysis, the goal is to develop a scalable, idempotent framework for evaluating the viability of draft decks based on various in-game parameters.

## Objectives
- **Develop a regression model** to predict deck performance based on draft choices.
- **Analyze cross-set learning** to determine how well models generalize across different MTG expansions.
- **Ensure idempotency** in data processing workflows for consistent, repeatable analysis.
- **Optimize scalability** to accommodate large datasets and evolving deck strategies.
- **Refine draft evaluation metrics** using domain knowledge and empirical testing.

## Approach
- Collect and preprocess draft data from available sources.
- Engineer relevant features to enhance model performance.
- Experiment with multiple regression techniques and validation strategies.
- Implement sustainable **Docker workflows** for machine learning frameworks.
- Iterate model refinements based on performance benchmarks.

## Dependencies
- **Python** (with an emphasis on modular, scalable design)
- **Pandas / NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning modeling
- **Docker** for environment management
- **MTG dataset sources** (to be specified)

## Future Considerations
- Expanding the project to **incorporate alternative machine learning techniques** such as deep learning.
- Investigating meta-strategies that **optimize draft choices dynamically**.
- Structuring the workflow for potential **collaborative contributions**.
