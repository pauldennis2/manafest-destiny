# Manafest Destiny Reflection

## Accomplishments

Overall I'm quite satisfied with this project. I explored a variety of models. I feel that I had strong reasons to expect a neural network to be the optimal solution, but when a large number of model structures and different hyperparameters were producing results inferior to random forest and XGBoost I moved on. Even though it wasn't a part of the technical work, I enjoyed incorporating the logos/heraldry symbols I created with Copilot before the project formally started.

## Growth

The biggest struggle on this project was in understanding how much randomness I was dealing with; I clearly underestimated this going in. When I found early R-squared values of ~4%, I thought I just hadn't found the right engineered features or model and that I would soon be approaching values of 20-30%. In future projects, I would hope to engage with this issue earlier with a serious discussion of just how much randomness there is in what I'm trying to predict.

I also feel like I may have underestimated the complexity of explaining the "Magic" world to an unfamiliar audience. I was aware of this problem going in, but made a classic "expert mistake" of thinking this was all easy to explain.

## Improvements/Next Steps

If I had more time to continue working on this project, there are a few areas I would like to explore.

### Automated LLM Analysis

Integrating the generated statistics/analysis for each set with an LLM type tool to automate initial analysis and turn it into human readable advice. This would be interesting from a technical perspective but probably not the most useful.

### Further Exploration of Neural Net

Going in to this project I was convinced that NN was the optimal solution. I'm less convinced of that now, but if I had time to explore without worry about results, trying an even larger variety of structures could be interesting. I did explore a lot of possibilities given the time constraints. 

### Drafting Analysis

To be honest, going into the actual draft data would be more like an entirely new project (and probably a larger one). I feel the decision to avoid that scope creep was correct, but this feels like the next logical big step. Basically, this project showed (for a given set) what types of decks work. Analysis of the drafting process would really dive into HOW to build a strong deck.
